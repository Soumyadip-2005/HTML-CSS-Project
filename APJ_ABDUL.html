                <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
                <p>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, often referred to as the "People's President" and the "Missile Man of India,"
                    was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India. A highly respected aerospace
                    engineer, Kalam played a pivotal role in India's civilian space program and military missile
                    development. He served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Dr. Kalam's contributions
                    to India's space and defense capabilities were exemplary. He played a crucial role in the
                    development of India's first satellite launch vehicle and ballistic missile
                    systems. His leadership at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Defense Research
                    and Development Organization (DRDO) left an indelible mark on the country's technological
                    advancements. Despite his illustrious career, Kalam remained humble and approachable, earning the
                    affection of the masses.
